One cis-regulatory element can regulate several genes,[2] and conversely, one gene can have several cis-regulatory modules.[3] Cis-regulatory modules carry out their function by integrating the active transcription factors and the associated co-factors at a specific time and place in the cell where this information is read and an output is given.[4]
CRMs are stretches of DNA, usually 100â€“1000 DNA base pairs in length,[1] where a number of transcription factors can bind and regulate expression of nearby genes and regulate their transcription rates.
CREs typically regulate gene transcription by binding to transcription factors. A single transcription factor may bind to many CREs, and hence control the expression of many genes (pleiotropy)

The design of cis-regulatory modules is such that transcription factors and epigenetic modifications serve as inputs, and the output of the module is the command given to the transcription machinery, which in turn determines the rate of gene transcription or whether it is turned on or off.[1]

Cis-regulatory module in gene regulatory network
The function of a gene regulatory network depends on the architecture of the nodes, whose function is dependent on the multiple cis-regulatory modules.[1] The layout of cis-regulatory modules can provide enough information to generate spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression.[1] During development each domain, where each domain represents a different spatial regions of the embryo, of gene expression will be under the control of different cis-regulatory modules.[1] The design of regulatory modules help in producing feedback, feed forward, and cross-regulatory loops.[9]

These are patches of DNA sequence that include the various elements recognized and bound by transcription factors, including those that respond to signal transduction pathways. Cis-regulatory modules determine the outputs of the genes they service, i.e., the time, place, and rate of expression, according to their inputs, which are provided by the transcription factors presented in the current cellular regulatory state (Istrail et al., 2007). In developmental GRNs, the outputs of regulatory genes mainly feed into the cis-regulatory modules controlling other regulatory genes, except at the periphery of the GRN where the linkages lead to differentiation genes and structural morphogenesis genes. Typically GRNs include complicated feedback, feedforward, and cross-regulatory loops.

GRNs offer a mechanistic view of how the embryonic body plan is formed through lineage specification, differentiation, and morphogenesis. They directly relate the processes of development to the genomic regulatory code, and thus provide a central avenue of understanding why development occurs as it does.

Steady states of kinetic equations thus correspond to potential cell types, and oscillatory solutions to the above equation to naturally cyclic cell types. Mathematical stability of these attractors can usually be characterized by the sign of higher derivatives at critical points, and then correspond to biochemical stability of the concentration profile. Critical points and bifurcations in the equations correspond to critical cell states in which small state or parameter perturbations could switch the system between one of several stable differentiation fates. Trajectories correspond to the unfolding of biological pathways and transients of the equations to short-term biological events
